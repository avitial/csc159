<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In the 1st phase of our OS project the kernel is driven by its
internal timer device that we have experimented. The creation,
scheduling, and running, of simple thread-based processes are
what we will use to test this time-sharing capability.
<p>
<li>
A mix of pseudo and actual code files are given in <i><b>Src</b></i>.
What you learned from the timer-event handling is crucial to complete
this phase.
<p>
<li>
Again, copying given files can be done by issuing the shell command:
"<b><tt>cp ~changw/html/159/1/Src/* .</tt></b>" (Note the "dot" symbol
at the end which means <i>your current directory</i> (as the destination
to copy).
<p>
<li>
Avoid <tt>copy-paste</tt> from what a webpage shows since it may contain
extra characters such as <tt>Ctrl-M</tt> that can cause compiler errors.
<p>
</ol>
<p>

<h3>The "Src" Skeleton</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The <b><i>Src</i></b> directory contains actual and pseudo code
that you need: the bootstrap of your OS is to:
<li>first initialize the data the OS will use,
<li>set up control environment (timer-event handling),
<li>create the first process (<i>Init</i>), and
<li>load the first process into CPU (and it runs).
<p>
<li>
What the <i>Init</i> process does is running an infinite loop
showing its PID (1) about every second. While doing so, timer
events occur in the background and the kernel code will be
invoked and run, and subsequently call its timer handler.
The timer event occurs at the rate of 100 Hz.
<p>
<li>
The timer handler counts the CPU runtime of the running process
and compare it against a preset time limit, and then set the kernel
to choose a different process to run next when the limit is reached.
A pool of processes that are ready to run can have their PID's queue
in a queue to be selected. Our kernel can thus alternate the running
process with the <i>round-robin</i> timer-sharing scheduling policy.
<p>
<li>
We also have the kernel coded to catch for a key entry on the Target PC
to handle it as:
   <ol>
   <li>if <i><b>n</b></i> key, create a new process by calling <tt>NewProcHandler()</tt>.
   <li>if <i><b>b</b></i> key, go into the GDB prompt for debugging work or exit.
   </ol>
<p>
<li>
<i>TimerHandler()</i> upcounts <tt>cpu_time</tt> of the Process Control
Block (PCB) of the current running process. This count is then compared
to <tt>TIME_LIMIT</tt>. If they are equal, the process will be <i>suspended</i>
(a form of <i>preemption</i>). A suspended process will have its PID appended
(enqueued) to the tail of ready-to-run process queue for its next turn.
<p>
<li>
<tt>Scheduler()</tt> dequeues the next PID from the ready-to-run process
queue only when needed. E.g., the current running PID has been reset by
TimerHandler. In that case, the first process in the ready-to-run PID
queue will be chosen (dequeued) to run.
<p>
<li>
A process <tt>state</tt> can be changed by event handlers. The
<tt>ready_q</tt> has PID's of those that are ready to run. The state
of these processes are all <tt><b>READY</tt></b>. There is only one
process (at most) that has the <tt>RUN</tt> state, therefore, there
is no need to have a queue for it. The PID's of processes not being
used are queued in <tt>free_q</tt> and their state is <tt>FREE</tt>.
<p>
<li>
When a new process is to be created, a PID from the free queue is
first dequeued by <i>NewProcHandler()</i> which does the rest of
the creation work. The PID is to be queued into the <tt>ready_q</tt>.
<p>
<li>
The <tt>free_q</tt> is initially queued with numbers 1 to 19, while
the <tt>ready_q</tt> is initially empty. The first process <tt>Init</tt>
will be created by <i>NewProcHandler</i> and PID 1 since that is the
first number to be dequeued from <tt>free_q</tt>.
<p>
<li>
Each PID queue has a 20-integer array called <i>q</i> and an integer
<i>size</i> to indicate its current size. The code <tt><b>tools.c</tt></b>
is to be completed to facilitate enqueue and dequeue functions, besides
<tt>MyBzero()</tt> used to clear data blocks. These are small kernel tools.
<p>
<li>
Each process has a <i>Process Control Block</i> (PCB) the kernel maintains:
   <ol>
   <li><i>int</i> <b>state</b>, process state: FREE, RUN, READY, SLEEP, WAIT, and ZOMBIE
   <li><i>int</i> <b>cpu_time</b>: counting up by the timer handler routine, set to zero when
   it is selected to start a new run by <tt>Scheduler</tt>.
   <li><i>TF_t *</i><b>TF_p</b>: saved CPU context, located in the process runtime stack.
   </ol>
<p>
<li>
A process trapframe is constructed by <tt>NewProcHandler()</tt> as the
initial CPU context to load and run a brand new process. The state of the
CPU can be saved into a trapframe in the process' own runtime stack.
Conversely, to load/resume a process is loading this trapframe back to
the CPU (by <tt>Loader()</tt>, coded in <i>events.S</i>).
<p>
<li>
The <tt>Init</tt> process is specially created during the OS bootstrap
<tt>main()</tt>, and the CPU instruction pointer (<tt>EIP</tt>) in the
trapframe is set at the <tt>Init()</tt> code. All other processes created by
pressing <i>'n'</i> will have their <tt>EIP</tt> point to <tt>UserProc()</tt>
instead.
<p>
<li>
A timer event must be dismissed (as how you did it in <i>Timer Event Handling
Lab</i>). Otherwise, <i>PIC</i> will not further notify CPU on the next timer
event. (Lack of dismissal indicates the CPU is still handling the previous one.)
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
By now you should have formed your OS team with another partner (at most 2
persons in a team), and mail the instructor: the team name and member names.
Team names must not have spaces or special symbols, and are case sensitive.
So the instructor can create team directories for you to turn in source files.
<li>
Submit only the source files needed to compile from scratch. Do not submit
any other files generated by the compiler or SPEDE tools. Source files are
those that their names end in <b><i>.c</i></b>, <b><i>.h</b></i>, and <b><i>.S</b></i>
only.
<li>
Penalty may apply if failing following what stated above.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
What is a trapframe? How is it used?
<p>
<li>
Why <i>asm("sti");</i> is not used in phase 1? (In the timer event handling
lab we did.)
<p>
<li>
How can the <i>round-robin</i> process scheduling be modified to carry out
other types of scheduling policies? (There are so many in the OS studies...)
<p>
<li>
What are the pros and cons of cooperative OS versus preemptive OS? (Perhaps
after phase 2, you can answer this better.)
</ol>
