Setting up a virtual environment for SPEDE and FLAMES for CpE 159/CSc 159 assignments.

Requirements:
	x86-based (or AMD64-based) PC (Windows or Mac), the host machine.
	This virtual lab uses around ~4.5GB of disk space on the host machine.

Downloads:
	Oracle's VirtualBox (for Mac or Windows) 
		https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
	
	Ubuntu Linux disk image x86 only (not AMD64) 
		Version 12.04.5 (or 12.x) LTS is preferred
		http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads
	
	FLAMES.OVA (DOS BOX with FLAMES preconfigured)

Install and configure Linux and SPEDE:
	Run VirtualBox and create a new Ubuntu virtual machine and use the Ubuntu.img as your install disk:
		From the VirtualBox menu: Machine -> New...		
		Optional: Install VirtualBox drivers (Devices->Insert Guest Additions CD Image...).

	Copy the SPEDE installation files to your Ubuntu VM using the Terminal:
		scp -r YOUR_ECS_USER_NAME@athena.ecs.csus.edu:~spede2/easy_install ~/Downloads/

	Create /home/project/spede2/: 
		sudo mkdir -p /home/project/spede2/

	Copy Target-i386.tgz file to /home/project/spede2:
		sudo cp ~/Downloads/easy_install/Target-i386.tgz /home/project/spede2/

	Decompress the file:
		sudo tar -zxf Target-i386.tgz

	Verify you have the folder Target-i386 in /home/project/spede2/:
		test -d /home/project/spede2/Target-i386 && echo "Yes" || echo "No"
		
	Copy the folder Target-i386 to /gaia/home/project/spede2: 
		sudo mkdir -p /gaia/home/project/spede2/
		sudo cp -r /home/project/spede2/Target-i386 /gaia/home/project/spede2

	Install vim:
		sudo apt-get install vim

	Add the binary paths to the SPEDE commands:
	Add these lines to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:
		export PATH=''/home/project/spede2/Target-i386/i686/gnu/bin:$PATH''
		export PATH=''/home/project/spede2/Target-i386/i686/tools/bin:$PATH''

	Now to enable the serial port connection at boot-up:
	Add this line before the statement ???exit 0??? in /etc/rc.local file:
		chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0

	Install gawk:
		sudo apt-get install gawk
	
    Congrats, your Ubuntu Linux is properly setup!

Import and configure FLAMES.OVA DOS-BOX virtual machine.
	Import FLAMES.OVA (File->Import Appliance...):
		Select FLAMES.OVA and complete the importing process.

	Pull up the flames settings (Machine->Settings).

	Select Ports tab, then Serial Ports tab and then Port 1 tab. 
	   	Config Settings are:
		   Check Enable Serial Port checkbox. 
		   Port Number: COM1.
		   Port Mode: Host Pipe.
	   	   UNCHECK Create Pipe checkbox.
		   Port/File Path: 
			The pipe name must be in the format:
				Windows: \\.\pipe\<name>
				Mac: /Users/*user name here*/<name>
			where <name> should identify the virtual machine but may be freely chosen,
			use serialPortPipe as an example.
      
Configure Ubuntu virtual machine:
	The next steps require the Ubuntu VM not to be running. 
	Pull up the Ubuntu VM settings (Machine->Settings).

	Select Ports tab, then select Serial Ports tab and then Port 1 tab. 
		Config Settings are:
		   Check Enable Serial Port. 
		   Port Number: COM1.
		   Port Mode: Host Pipe.
		   Check the Create Pipe check box.
		   Port/File Path: Must match the same path as set in flames virtual machine above.

Congrats, you have fully configured a working virtual lab!

Starting Procedure:
	Always run the Ubuntu Linux virtual machine first, then run the FLAMES virtual machine next.
	An error will appear saying a pipe does not exist if FLAMES is run first.
	You can always start/restart/shutdown the FLAMES box at any time after Ubuntu Linux is started.
 
Compile your sources and download a .dli file to the target machine.
	Here are some commands you can use to get this done:
		spede-mkmf (creates a makefile from scratch)
		make clean
		make
		flash MyOS.dli
			Command within flash:
			download (or d)
			make (or make clean)
			gdb
			flint
			Commands within flint:
				After downloading the file, type g and hit return to execute your OS.
