Steps to setup a terminal for SPEDE in VirtualBox
-------------------------------------------------

1. Go to Settings -> Serial Ports in flames VM

2. Enable Port 2 and set same options as in Port 1,
    but make sure you have a different Port/File Path
    for it.

3. Go to Settings -> Serial Ports in spede VM

4. Enable Port 2 in the same way Port 1 is enabled,
    but point it to the file path you set in step 2.

5. Install minicom in the Ubuntu spede VM
    sudo apt-get install minicom

6. Start minicom as the root user
    sudo minicom

7. Enter minicom configuration and find the
    "cOnfigure Minicom..O" option.

8. Once there, enter the "Serial port setup" screen

9. Set the value for "Serial Device" to the serial port (e.g. COM2 is  /dev/ttyS1)

10. Save your configuration and restart using the
    "Quit with no reset." option from the main screen

11. Start minicom again as root user. Your main screen should look like this (note Port):

    Welcome to minicom 2.6.2

    OPTIONS: I18n
    Compiled on Feb  8 2013, 06:27:51.
    Port /dev/ttyS1, 03:01:12

    Press CTRL-A Z for help on special keys

12. Start running your OS as you normally would. You should see the terminal login (see attached picture).
