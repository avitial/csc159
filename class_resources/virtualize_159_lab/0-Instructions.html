This is the most current write-up, updated 1-31-2017, Dr. Chang, copyfree.
<i>Katya Niosi</i> made most files here to make it easier to set up, including a video.

First try things out in the real lab (RVR2001).
<i>Must experience the real world before going into a virtual one, or be forever lost...</i>

A. Get these files:
   1. the <i>VirtualBox install app</i> (Mac or Windows) and install it.
      (Originals are from <i>http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</i>.)
   2. ova files (modified from <i>Aaron Diab's</i> google drive which is at:
          <i>https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bxey6BVAiq7kM1ViSjNEUXZWN3c&usp=sharing</i>
          <i>SPEDE.ova</i> -- Linux (Unbuntu) PC disk image, including our SPEDE software,
          <i>flames.ova</i> -- target PC disk image, including DOS and FLAMES.)

B. <i>Import</i> these .ova files to make them virtual machines.
   1. Run VirtualBox app, the left column shown blank space.
   2. Pick from top menu: <i>File->Import Applicance</i>.
   3. Navigate to file <i>LinuxPC.ova</i> and import it, and it shows onto the left,
      Import <i>TargetPC.ova</i> the same way.
      As to <i>Terminal1.ova, Terminal2.ova, and Printer.ova</i>; they can wait.
   4. Set in VirtualBox Preferences: <i>Input -> uncheck "Auto Capture..."</i>

C. Check settings of the virtual machines (especially those <i>Ports</i>).
   1. Highlight the <i>LinuxPC</i> machine icon from the left.
   2. Click <i>Settings</i> icon (looks like a sprocket icon).
   3. Click <i>Ports</i> icon.
   4. Pick <i>Serial Ports</i> side.
   5. Pick <i>Port 1</i> (already highlighted among the 4 ports placed in a row).
   6. Check <i>Enable Serial Port</i> box.
   7. For Port Number, select <i>COM1</i> (IRQ and I/O numbers are fixed/correct).
   8. For Port Mode, select <i>Host Pipe</i>.
   9. Uncheck <i>Connect to existing pipe/socket</i> box (we want it to create new)
   a. for <i>Path/Address</i>: on a Mac computer, enter <b>/tmp/LinuxPCtoTargetPC</b>
      (overwrite any old typing). In a Windows computer, it's <b>\\.\pipe\LinuxPCtoTargetPC</b>.
   b. Pick <i>USB</i> side (next to <i>Serial Ports</i>).
   c. Uncheck <i>Enable USB...</i> box.
   d. Click <i>Display</i> icon.
   e. Uncheck <i>Enable 3D...</i> box (otherwise it starts very slow).

------------- That's it! Try Your First Run (like in RVR2001) -------------

D. Run <i>LinuxPC</i> by highlighting it on the left, and click <i>Start</i>.
   You should see the Ubuntu Desktop (may come up very slowly if the <i>Enable 3D...</i>
   box is not unchecked (see step e. above).
   Press <i>Left-Command</i> key whenever your mouse cursor disappears.
   Open a terminal by double-click the Terminal icon on Ubuntu Desktop, enter
   <b>chsh</b> to switch shell (password <b>spedeuser</b>) to <b>/bin/tcsh</b> and close the
   terminal, and open a new one (new <i>tcsh</i> reads the <i>.cshrc</i> file
   which has a new search path for SPEDE commands). Test this by entering
   <b>spede-mkmf</b> at the tcsh shell prompt and it should run (and just enter
   <b>n</b> when asked to quit). You can also manually start the <i>tcsh</i> by
   entering <b>tcsh</b> if you're still using <i>bash</i> (enter <i>ps</i> to see
   which shell that's running).
   The Ubuntu username is <i>user</i> (execute shell command <b>whoami</b> to check)
   and the password is <i>spedeuser</i> (to unlock the screen saver for instance).

E. Run <i>TargetPC</i>, and you see a blinking line-cursor waits downloads.

F. At the Ubuntu terminal tcsh prompt (<i>LinuxPC</i>), enter the following:
      <i>tcsh %</i> <b>wget athena.ecs.csus.edu/~changw/159/0/lab4stuff/Demo.dli</b>
      or <b>scp -r athena.ecs.csus.edu/~changw/html/159/0/lab4stuff/Demo.dli .</b>
      <i>tcsh %</i> <b>flash Demo.dli</b>
      <i>FLASH %</i> <b>download</b>
      <i>FLASH %</i> <b>flint</b>
      <i>FLAMES></i> <b>g</b>
   The <i>g</i> means <b>go</b>, not <i>gdb</i> (as it would when entered at the <i>FLASH</i> prompt).
   You should see the demo run on <i>TargetPC</i> as how it would in the lab (RVR2001).
   If needed, press <i>CTRL-C</i> to stop the runtime and quit:
      <i>FLASH %</i> <b>quit</b>
      <i>tcsh %</i> (back to shell)

-------------------- Copying/Moving Your Source Files ----------------------

   To directly access the class turn-in dropbox (served by host Voyager)
   from the virtual Ubuntu is the same way as that from a regular ECS
   Linux (see instruction linked from the class webpage). Just use the
   full hostname path: <i>voyager.ecs.csus.edu</i> where <i>voyager</i> is mentioned.

   The <i>git</i> tool is also installed in this Unbuntu virtual machine.

   To send files with "secure copy" (<i>scp</i>) to host such as <i>titan.ecs.csus.edu</i>
      <i>tcsh %</i> <b>scp * (your ECS username)@titan.ecs.csus.edu:~/my159phase1</b>
   It will ask to add the titan host into a list (enter <i>yes</i>) and in the
   destination subdirectory <i>my159phase1</i> ill be first created under
   your login directory.

   To use <i>scp</i> to copy files from a real Linux host:
      <i>tcsh %</i> <b>scp -r (your ECS username)@titan.ecs.csus.edu:~/myStuff Stuff2</b>
   The remote is an existing directory, and <i>Stuff2</i> is a local directory which
   will be created. The <i>-r</i> option will recursively copy everything inside
   that remote directory, including any subdirectories and further.

----------------------------- Adding Printer -----------------------------

Importing <i>Printer.ova</i>.
   Change the path of the host pipe if needed when using a Mac.

   (IRQ7 signal is not simulated by Virtual Box so the interrupt-driven
   mode will not work. Only the busy-poll method works.)

---------------------------- Adding Terminals ----------------------------

Importing <i>Terminal1.ova</i> and <i>Terminal2.ova</i>.
   Check/change the paths of <i>Host Pipes</i> if needed (Windows or Mac).

-------------------------- Starting Sequence -----------------------------

   Because which ports should be created first matters, start <i>LinuxPC</i>
   before <i>TargetPC</i>; or error messages will occur. Although unchecking
   the <i>Connect to existing...</i> box for both sides would result no error
   messages, but the <i>.dli</i> download communication will hang at the start.

   At where <i>Path/Address</i> is specified the pipe file will be seen being
   created as a machine runs. Unchecking the <i>Connect to existing...</i> box
   to have the first machine create it and a later machine to look for it.
   Checking the box means another machine has created it beforehand. Hence,
   the sequence to start a number of machines matters (cannot be arbitrary).
   To simply just uncheck all machines will not work, either; since the
   re-creation of the same named file does not mean the actual location
   remains the same in the storage (especially not for SSD devices), i.e.,
   even with the same filename, the file system would reclaim all resources
   associated with the old one, and assign a new stoarge location; and the
   first machine would read into an incorrect location.

   A <i>pipe</i> is one of many interprocess communcation methods. A named
   pipe is a file hosted by the actual machine to buffer data to transfer,
   hence the name <i>host pipe</i>. To create a file in the given directory
   path requires the read/write access privilege of the user that runs the
   VirtualBox, therefore, the file location specified must be where your
   processes are allowed to read/write. Otherwise, an error message about
   not being able to find/create the host pipe will occur, similar to the
   above problem about check/unchecking the <i>Connect to exisiting...</i> box.
   Linux/Mac uses the <i>/tmp</i> directory while Windows uses <i>\\.\pipe</i>
   as a public scrap space by any processes with no access restriction.
