<b>All questions should be answered based on project phases and lectures</b>

<b>I. True/False</b>

1.  _T_  F   The functions in services.c is to pass/receive information between a
             process and the kernel, not actually performing any kernel services.
             (How is a "system service call" done?)

2.  _T_  F   To handle an IRQ event, as well as the execution of "int 0x??"
             instruction (in a service call), require fetching a jump point for new
             CPU instructions.

3.  _T_  F   (Continued.) Jump points are fretched from the IDT.

4.   T  _F_  (Continued.) The handling always needs an interrupt dismissal (by
             using function outportb).

5.   T  _F_  Since IRQ-0 has the highest priority for hardware interrupts, the
             TimerEventHandler will be executed even when the CPU is currently
             running the code in the handlers.c. (Why/why not?)

6.  _T_  F   The kernel execution can be regarded as a big <i>critical</i> section
             during which any new interrupts are never acknowledged, nor serviced.

7.   T  _F_  A SemPost() call may block the running process.

8.   T  _F_  The IDT has 200 entries and we have used 5 entries so far.

9.   T  _F_  (Continued.) We set IDT entries via our "SetEntry()" function.

10. _T_  F   (Continued) With different code addresses from source file "events.S."

<b>II. Multiple Choice</b>

1. ( B ) While the instructions are being fetched and executed from within
        a function of "services.c," the CPU stack pointer would be pointing:
        A. in the kernel stack
        B. in the process stack
        C. first in the process stack, then in the kernel stack
        D. first in the process stack, then in the kernel stack,
           then back in the process stack
        E. first in the kernel stack, then in the process stack,
           then back in the kernel stack

2. ( D ) What happens when a process first calls "Sleep(-1)" and later
        your OS checks for waking up with comparison of "... == ..."
        for the system time and waking time?
        A. the process will be in the available state forever
        B. the process will be in the ready state forever
        C. the process will be in the run state forever
        D. the process will be in the sleep state forever
        E. the process will be in the wait state forever

3. ( B ) What would happen if a process calls "Sleep(0)" instead,
        yet your OS checks for waking up first before increments
        the system time occurred?
        A. the process will be in the available state
        B. the process will be in the ready state
        C. the process will be in the run state
        D. the process will be in the sleep state
        E. the process will be in the wait state

4. ( C ) The kernel service code for the semaphore-wait has no use of:
        A. a semaphore ID
        B. setting some number to 0
        C. dequeuing from a wait queue
        D. changing a process' state to WAIT
        E. downcounting the passes

5. ( E ) The <i>trapframe pointer</i> Kernel() gets as its argument, is saved
        at the beginning into a PCB. This is because:
        A. a process was interrupted at its runtime unscheduled, the content
           of the trapframe varies.
        B. the CPU registers vary when an interrupt occurs, the PCB of the
           interrupted process must be updated with new CPU registers.
        C. the processs is interrupted unscheduled during runtime, the PCB
           location varies.
        D. the stack pointer must return to the original location when the
           process was created.
        E. the stack pointer might be pointing at a different location from
           where the previous trapframe was when an interrupt occurred, so,
           where the new trapframe was built may vary.

6. ( 2 ) How many kernel services we have so far may "stop" a process? (The type
        of kernel service that may alter the running process ID to "none.")
        A. 1   B. 2   C. 3   D. 4   E. 5

<b>III. Short Answers</b>

1. Write out a procedure description to introduce a new kernel service X.

2. About the exception such as an invalid argument used in the call "Sleep(-1),"
   where would be the proper place to handling this?

3. Without checking for the above exception, what can it affect in the kernel
   code and service logic?

4. Consider the way our OS uses its data structure as resources, what can be
   the possible places in our kernel code that would cause resource leaks
   if not coded correctly.

5. Answer review questions given at the of the webpage of each project phase.
