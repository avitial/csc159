<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<blockquote>
Modern operating systems (OS) allow CPUs and other resources to be shared
among many users (and processes) concurrently. The OS provides resource
management and controls among processes to guarantee the correctness of
operation.
This course is designed to give computer science and computer engineering
students an in-depth exposure to the OS operation through extensive
implementation of the OS structures.
<P>
This course is intended to provide you with practical, hands-on
experience in the details of OS design and implementation.
The various OS principles covered in CSc139 are considered from the
viewpoint of actual code implementation on computers.
After spending covering the architectural details of the target machine,
you will start to write interrupt-handler code for various type of
interrupts. Special emphasis will be given to the implementation of
thread process creation, dispatching code, synchronization, and to the
development of a complete set of OS kernel services capable of supporting
typical embedded-system applications.
You will implement several client/server-type processes running on the
target machine using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms provided by
their kernels. Kernel threads will provide services to the upper layers of the
system.
<P>
Attention will be given to the development and debugging techniques typical
in embedded/remote-target computer systems as well as stand-alone general-purpose machines.
You will download and debug OS routines from a separate workstation.
<P>
Emphasis will be placed on the design, implementation techniques, and
tradeoffs typically in the development of modern operating systems, from
the viewpoint of both general-purpose time-sharing systems and ubiquitous
embedded systems. <i>Discussion will include essentials and advanced issues
in the building of real-time systems, embedded systems, and multiprocessor
systems</i>.
<P>
Operating systems are complex, and, by their nature, are very sensitive to
the orders of events. Writing code is a form of communication both to yourself
and other programmers, as well as to the actual CPU that executes the compiled
code. You are expected to demonstrate organization and documentation
skills in their programming assignments.
<em>which is important since each assignment builds on the previous ones.</em>
Comments serve to communicate critical issues and detail of possible hazards
in the code.
<P>
After completing this course, you will have gained a comprehensive
understanding of the organizational structure of modern operating-system code.
They will have achieved considerable practical experience with implementation
methods and tools similar to those used in computer systems development in
the industry.

<H3>Course Grading</H3>
<blockquote>
The semester letter grade will be based on the distribution curve, derived
from the total points earned from all project assignments (50%) and written
exams (50%) -- midterm and final exams.
<p>
This class requires a lot of time from you. The program you create for
this class will probably be the largest computer program you've written
here at school. Additionally, each assignment is the starting point for
the next assignment, which is the starting point for even the latter
assignment, etc. So, do not get behind in the assignments.
<P>
Programming assignments must be turned in electronicly (will be tested
and asked for demonstration). All late assignments are subject to a fixed
<b>10%</b> reduction each day (time stamps are given by the source code
control system on the server host. 10% means 1 point if 10 points based.)
<P>
Please inform yourself of the Department-College-University policies
on dropping courses. An "incomplete" grade can only be given due to
unusual circumstances caused by reasons <em>beyond your own control</em>.
This normally means a letter from your medical doctor or employer, on
appropriate letterhead, stating that you are unable to complete the
semester attendances and assignments due to <em>illness or workload</em>.
</blockquote>

<H3>Project Grading Policy</h3>

<blockquote>
The programming projects will be graded with the following policy.
<br>
Grading is based on a 10-point scale
<ul>
   <li>5 points - meeting functional requirements
   <li>5 points - correct source code (functional requirements first):
   <ul>
      <li>0.5 point, a minor error (compiler warnings, repeated initializations, etc.)
      <li>1 point, a major error (array index may go over, register names swapped, etc.)
   </ul>

   <li>The typical 159 problems:
   <ul>
      <li>fail to generate target OS during compile
      <li>fail to start runtime
      <li>fail to sustain runtime
      <li>fail to enter the debug mode as required
      <li>fail to proceed to exit as required
      <li>runtime exceptions/errors such as segfaults, SPEDE panics
      <li>runtime causes reboots
      <li>incorrect algorithms (may likely cause crash or OS malfunction)
      <li>OS features or data structures implemented incorrectly
      <li>incorrect semantic logic in code modularization
      <li>certain runtime requirements not met
      <li>(Surely many little things may also go wrong. Best re-study, re-check.)
   </ul>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<H3>Ethics</H3>
<blockquote>
Cheating and plagiarism are dealt with strictly in this class. All assignments
require your own work during the current semester. It is OK to discuss assignments
with others for the purpose of understanding the requirements but never about the
coding.
All work on team assignments for the class is to be done solely by yourself or
your team member unless explicitly stated otherwise. This includes problem analysis,
solution design, coding and testing.
When you or your team submits work, it constitutes a contractual agreement
that the work is solely the product of the named person or team members.
Further, submitted work carries with it an agreement that the instructors can
quiz you on the detail of the work for verification.
<P>
If anyone attempts to raise their grade through unethical means such
as working with or copying the work of others, it is in essence may cause
a lowering of others' grades. Further, anyone who <EM>gives</EM> such
help is equally guilty of unethical behavior because they failed to protect
the proprietariness of the information.
<P>
The 159 policy on ethics is succinctly stated in the University's Policy
Manual: <B>Cheating is the ground for dismissal from the University.</b>
</blockquote>

<H3>Important Notes About the Course</H3>
<blockquote>
Any adjustments to this syllabus will be announced in class. <EM>Class
attendance is very important!</EM> You are responsible for all materials
mentioned in class sessions. Class notes may not be mass produced.
<P>
There is a lot of code produced for this course. Each team will spend a
substantial amount of time in the lab through out the semester. Your team
is responsible for scheduling time together to work through the problems.
<EM>Since each project phase is to be built on the previous, do not get
behind!</EM>
The code of your program should be clear and well commented. Algorithms
and special coding practices should be explained.
<P>
