Phase 2 &nbsp; Kernel Services
</h3>
</center>

<b>Kernel Service 1: <tt>GetPid</tt></b>
<ol>
<li>
During the runtime of a process, all system information including
the running process ID should be kept secret and only be given by
the kernel through a service call which checks the validity of the
request. Thus, a process such as <tt>UserProc()</tt> will need to
make a request for service: <tt>GetPid()</tt> to get its own PID.
This is a <i>Kernel Service</i> which will suspend (voluntarily)
the process in order for the kernel code to execute. Afterward
the process may resume, or can be otherwise treated by the outcome
and nature of the requested service.
<p>
<li>
The service interface code is <b><i>services.c</i></b> which uses
<i>inline</i> assembly instructions to invoke the kernel, particularly
"<tt>int #</tt>" which voluntarily "interrupts" the process itself and
the hardware will following up to switch to the kernel code. That is
the main difference compared to a timer-device interrupt. However, there
is no PIC mask or to IRQ dismissal to deal with.
<p>
<li>
After the <i>int #</i> in <tt>GetPid()</tt> the process will resume
the code in <i>services.c</i> which is retrieving its PID from the
CPU <tt>EAX</tt> register. Thus the duty of the kernel handler
<tt>GetPidHandler</tt> is to place the PID of the running (but
now temporarily suspended) process into the trapframe (CPU register
EAX from which GetPid will later fetch).
<p>
<li>
Similar to how <tt>TimerEvent</tt> in <i>events.S</i> is coded, the
new <tt>GetPidEvent</tt> is to be added. The address of this new
event linkage code (in events.S) is to be added into the IDT at entry
number <b>100</b> (as the designated event number).
<p>
<li>
Coding hints are listed in the <a href=CodingHints.txt>CodingHints.txt</a>.
<p>
</ol>

<b>Kernel Service 2: <tt>Sleep</tt></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
The <tt><b>Sleep</tt></b> service is made available so a process
can use it instead of busy-delay the CPU for time control. The CPU
can then load and run some other processes, to be more efficiently
used.
The <tt>UserProc()</tt> can now use these kernel services which
replace the original CPU-delay loop. The seconds to sleep is simply
its own PID (use GetPid service to get it).
<p>
<li>
The service handler <b><tt>SleepHandler()</tt></b> first compute
the wake-up time of the process by adding the current system time
with the number of sleep seconds (times one hundred). The wake-up
time is then kept in the PCB. The process is then preempted. No
longer running. Its state is updated to <i>SLEEP</i>.
<p>
<li>
The <tt>TimerHandler()</tt> code is appended to upcount the current
system time upon every timer-interrupt event, and also check to see
if any processes need to be waken up, i.e., search through each
process if the state is <i>SLEEP</i> and the wake-up time has arrived.
If yes, move this process (ID) to the ready-to-run queue and update
its state.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
In order to keep a current system time, we add a number <i>current_time</i>
to the kernel data which is initialize with zero and upcounted in
<i>TiemrISR()</i>.

<p>
</ol>

<b>Deliverables</b>
<ul>
As before, via the SAMBA client <i>smbclient</i> to submit only the
source files (not binary files or intermediate compiler files) into
your team folder in <i>phase2</i>.
</ul>

<b>Review Questions</b>
<ol>
<li>
Identify the differences between the setting up and handling of a
hardware interrupt (such as the timer device), and a kernel service?
<li>
Why bother to save the pointer argument at the beginning of Kernel()?
<li>
How do you compare the two numbers when checking if a process requires
to be waken up?  Do you think using "equal" would be good enough, or
"greater-equal" (or "less-equal" if the two numbers reversed) is needed?
<li>
What can happen with <i>your</i> OS if testing code such as "Sleep(0)"
or even "Sleep(-1)" is given? What is best to handle these exceptions?
<li>
Can our system time ever differ real time (wall clock) after a period
of time that is sufficiently lengthy (to ever cause anything like this
to happen)?
</ol>
