Phase 6 &nbsp; File Services
</big></b></center>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>
To provide individual processes a basic set of <i>file services</i>
which are to be hosted by our OS kernel.
<p>
<li>
In this phase a terminal process starts with a login dialogue and
then performs a few simple file-service commands:
<ol type=A>
<li><tt>pwd</tt> -- printing out Current Working Directory, <i>CWD</i>, same as "echo $CWD."
<li><tt>cd</tt> <i>a subdirectory name (or root directory)</i> - to mimic unix.
   The login directory starts at the root directory. There is a current working
   directory string variable, <i>CWD</i>, which will be changed to the <i>full path</i>
   of the subdirectory (or "/") if it exists, e.g., "cd www" changes CWD <i>/</i> to
   <i>/www</i> after from login. CWD determines the location of the following two
   file services.
<li><tt>ls</tt> - to mimic unix. The current working directory (CWD) is listed.
<li><tt>cat</tt> <i>filename</i> - to mimic unix concatenate command. This command
   must be used in conjunction with the name of a file in the CWD.
<li><tt>exit</tt> - exits the login session and back to the login prompt.
   The password is the <tt>reverse</tt> of the login username entered.
</ol>
<li>Note: there are no mixture of directory and file names, or multiple directories,
e.g., "cat www/index.html" or "cd /www" (which should be just "cd www"). To move back
to the root directory, either "cd /" or "cd .." while CWD is in a subdirectory.
<li> The shell will prompt an associated error message to the user onto the terminal
upon errors.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>File Service Calls</h3>
<blockquote>
Similar to a standard file service query protocol, but we will
experiment only four different services.
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<b><i>void FSfind(char *name, char *cwd, char *data)</b></i>:
to query the attributes of a named object (file/directory) in
the CWD, e.g., size, type, etc.; this service call is used
with two strings ("char" pointers) given as arguments. The first
is the object name to "stat" (check) and the second will carry
the information returned from the file service. The read data can
be casted to an "attribute type" pointer to decipher information.
<li>
<b><i>int FSopen(char *name, char *cwd)</b></i>:
To open the said named object for reading, this service call is used.
It returns a File Descriptor (FD) associated with the named object.
A file descriptor has an I/O "buffer" assigned for sequential reading.
<li>
<b><i>void FSread(int FD, char *read_data)</b></i>:
With the FD allocated, the reading is conducted in loop by calling
this service call. Each successful "read" call will fill the data from
the file into a buffer of which the address is passed to the kernel.
(This is not the same buffer the FD uses to the actual file storage.)
As the <i>EOF</i> condition occurs, the "read" will be empty (preceeding
with a null character).
<li>
<b><i>void FSclose(int FD)</b></i>:
To close (return) the allocated file buffer (FD), this service call
is used with the given FD as the argument.
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
Turn your source code in on your designated folder on host Voyager
as usual. Correct those places mentioned in the grading results
derived from all previous phases. (Do not correct code of previous
phases and resubmit. It is the new code that you are turning in
that needs attention and correction!) Otherwise, deductions repeat.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
How would you incorporate device drivers of storage media to
<i>upgrade</i> the file service to be a more realistic one?
<p>
<li>
How can file services be converted into the duty of a process
such as a file manager to handle? What can be the pros and cons
in doing so, in terms of performance, organization, etc?
