<big><b>Goals</big></b>
<p>
<blockquote>
In this development phase we extend our OS services with an interprocess
communication (IPC) method: <i>semaphores</i>. It provides a way processes
can collaborate to avoid "racing/conflicting" conditions when required for
their collective goal of operation.
<p>
This new service will be tested by several <i>Vehicle</i> processes. Similar to
the situation as multiple vehicles are to cross a small bridge that has a capacity
sign, there seems to be a virtual <i>semaphore</i> all drivers comply for a safe
crossing. With Vehicle processes, each will first issue a semaphore service for
getting a pass before its continuation in the code. If a pass is granted, the
process can continue (not blocked). If there are no passes left in the semaphore
requested at that time, the kernel handler code will suspend the calling process
by placing it into the wait queue of that semaphore (blocking). A process holding
a pass will normally later issue another semaphore-related service call to return
the given pass (or the privilege) so other future processes may get it (or a waited
process in the wait queue of that semaphore can be released and get to continue).
<p>
During the period a process holding the semaphore pass, the part of code executed
constitutes a guarded critical section of process runtime. Any data being accessed
during that runtime section is called critical data (guarded by the semaphore).
<p>
A semaphore is first allocated by a process with a preset number of passes to
initialize it. This number determines the maximum amount of processes that can
pass a guarded point and enter their individual critical section (provided they
all comply to the correct use of semaphores).

<big><b>Semaphore Handlers</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
There are three calls: <i>SemAlloc</i>, <i>SemWait</i>, and <i>SemPost</i>;
to allocate a semaphore (initialize it with a given number of passes),
to request for a pass, and to return a pass. The SemAlloc API has both input
and output for the inline assembler. This requires combining the "asm()"
syntax from both GetPid and Sleep calls learned in the previous OS phase.
<p>
<li>The call <tt>int SemAlloc(int passes)</tt> invokes <tt>void SemAllocHandler(int passes)</tt>
that allocates an available semaphore (no owner information), set its passes,
empty its wait queue, register the owner (to the current calling process),
and return this semaphore ID (<i>sid</i>) via the trapframe of the calling process.
<p>
<li>The call <tt>void SemWait(int sid)</tt> invokes <tt>void SemWaitHandler(int sid)</tt>
that decrement the passes of the semaphore by one if it has any left (above 0).
Otherwise, the calling process will be blocked by its PID queued to the wait
queue in the semaphore, state updated to <tt>WAIT</tt>, and resetting the OS
current PID.
<p>
<li>The call <tt>void SemPost(int sid)</tt> invokes <tt>void SemPostHandler(int sid)</tt>
which checks if there is any waiting process (previous blocked by a SemWait call,
in the wait queue of the semaphore <i>sid</i>). If none, increment the semaphore
passes by one. Otherwise, release it: dequeue the first waiting process from the
wait queue, append it to the ready-to-run PID queue, update its state.

<big><b>Kernel Code Settings</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
The <tt>CodingHints.txt</tt> lists what are needed to code your program
for this OS phase.
<p>
<li>
Our OS now has An array of semaphores <tt>sem_t sem[Q_SIZE]</tt> as part
of its resources to be allocated for processes to use but maintained
via kernel IPC service handling code. Each semaphore has an <i>owner</i>
(owning PID) when being used, a number <i>passes</i>, and a <i>wait_q</i>
(PID queue). The array indices are used as semaphore ID's (<i>sid</i>).
<p>
<li>
Declare a global integer (just for testing): <tt>vehicle_sid</tt> which
will be initialized to <b><i>-1</b></i> during the OS bootstrap, and
will later be allocated with a valid semaphore ID to be used by multiple
<i>Vehicle</i> processes for calling <i>SemWait</i> and <i>SemPost</i>.
<p>
<li>
The new constants in <tt>events.h</tt> are <tt>SEMALLOC_EVENT 102</tt>,
<tt>SEMWAIT_EVENT 103</tt>, and <tt>SEMPOST_INTR 104</tt>. Their event
linkage code is to be coded in <tt>events.S</tt> of course.
The IDT preparation during the OS bootstrap as well as the <i>switch</i>
statements in the main kernel function will mention these constants.
<p>
<li>
The <tt>void SemAllocHandler(int passes)</tt> allocates a semaphore by
finding any available semaphore that has no owner (PID is zero). Once
found the index of the semaphore array is to be returned to the calling
process via a register in its trapframe. If no semaphore left, a kernel
panic occurs. The allocated semaphore should have its owner and passes
set accordingly, and its wait queue emptied (use MyBzero tool).
<p>
<li>
The <tt>void SemWaitISR(int sid)</tt> first checks if the <i>passes</i>
of the semaphore is greater than zero. If so, decrement it by one. (No
process blocking is needed.) If it is already zero, the calling process
will need to be blocked. Hence, <i>SemWait</i> is a (potentially) "blocking"
service call. There can be variations of SemWait calls non-blocking for
purposes of solving <i>deadlock</i> conditions.

<big><b>Deliverables</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
Source code only dropped to your destinated dropbox folder on the host Voyager
as before.
</ol>
<p>

<big><b>Questions to Review</big></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Enter shell command on an ECS Linux host: ipcs -l for the information
about the semaphore service parametrics from the OS. Where are the "config"
files the OS administrator can set them? (Answers: /etc/sysctl.conf and
/proc/sys/kernel/sem.)
<p>
<li>
What if Vehicle processes start failing to call SemPost()? What kind of
condition can this be called? Can an OS detect and this type of condition?
Can it resolve this? Or should it?
<p>
<li>
What will be the purposes as the passes of a semaphore is to be set
with 1, 0, or even less than 0?
<p>
<li>
What are the definitions of <i>starvation</i>, <i>deadlock</i>, <i>livelock</i>?
Further, can you give examples?
