<big><b>Phase 7 &nbsp; Process Life Cycle</big></b>
</center>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<ol>
<li>
To cater for a process life cycle, our OS needs to have new services:
<tt>int Fork(int code)</tt>, <tt>int Wait(void)</tt>, and <tt>void
Exit(int)</tt>. The kernel will also manage the memory resource.
<p>
<li>
A typical shell command allows the creation of child processes to
perform executables readily compiled. A child process has its own code,
data, and runtime stack space. Processes are created by <i>Fork</i>
services. A parent process after the call will subsequently issue 
service call <i>Wait</i>. This is because a child process acts as
a subroutine inheriting the parent's environments (I/O channels)
and using them. The Wait call may block to avoid I/O clobbering. 
<p>
<li>
If a child process calls Exit() before its parent calls Wait(),
the <i>ExitHandler</i> will suspend the child process by placing
it in a <tt>ZOMBIE</tt> state (the resources are not yet reclaimed
by the kernel). As the parent later calls Wait(), the zombie child
is then really terminated with resources all reclaimed. An <tt><b>
exit number</tt></b> will then be given to the parent process.
<p>
The parent (TermProc) will have a new command <b><tt>echo</b></tt>
which shows the exit number from the child process exited, onto
the terminal. The given demo code <tt>sleep3.s</tt> in the
<tt>bin-code</tt> sleeps for 3 seconds and returns the address
of its starting instruction. Read the code.
</ol>

<h3>Programming Details</h3>
<ol>
<li>
There given <i><b>sleep3.s</b></i> is what you must first build to
added into the file-service data. It will appear as an executable
in the <i>bin</i> directory so it can be executed. Run the demo.
<p>
<li>
When a command string is entered from the terminal, TermProc can have
a subroutine <tt>void TermBin(char *name, char *cwd, int my_port,
int *exit_num)</tt> to deal with it. In this new subroutine, it
first asks the file service to get the attribute information of
the command, and check if it is an executable, before issuing
a Fork() call which is given the location of the executable (part
of the attribute information). A child process will be created
and scheduled to run the executable. TermProc then issues a Wait()
call to wait for the executable to exit, and an exit number will
be returned. This may block the parent (TermProc). The child process
eventually ends and issue an Exit() call which unblocks TermProc
and returns the the exit number.
<p>
<li>
The <i>ForkHandler</i> first allocates a new PID and memory page.
It then clears both contents, sets the parent PID (<b>ppid</b>) in
the PCB (the calling process). The state of the new process is set
to READY and the PID is enqueued to ready_q. 
The memory page is a 4K-byte page (common unit size for storage).
The executable code will be copied from the file system to the
memory page along. The stack space will hold the initial trapframe
that is built towards the end of the memory page. The trapframe
address in the PCB is not set in proc_stack[][], and the program
counter (EIP) of the trapframe is set at the start of the memory page.
<p>
<li>
At OS bootstrap, the resource of 100 memory pages are collected as
<tt><b>mem_page_t mem_page[<i>MEM_PAGE_NUM</i>]</tt></b>. Each holds an owning
PID information and pointer to a whole memory page: <b>int owner</b> and
<b>char *addr</b>. Owners are all set to be 0 to indicate availability,
and addresses are set from 14M (0xE00000, where MyOS.dli ends) with an
increment of 4096 bytes (<i>MEM_PAGE_SIZE</i>).
<p>
<li>
About WaitHandler. As a parent process calls Wait() before any its
child process calls Exit(), the handler will fail to find any ZOMBIE
child of its and thus block the parent process by setting its state
to <tt>WAIT</tt>, etc. Otherwise, the exit number given by the child
will be relayed to the parent process. The resources (PCB and memory)
the child process was using will also be reclaimed by the OS.
<p>
<li>
About ExitHandler. As a child process calls Exit() with an exit number,
before its parent calls Wait(); the handler will "suspend" the child
process by changing its state to <tt><b>ZOMBIE</b></tt> (not totally
terminated since resources are not reclaimed). Otherwise, the blocked
parent (see above) is released to ready_q, with the exit number relayed.
The resources of the child process are then reclaimed.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<blockquote>
In the usual place, submit the source code including your
<i><b>bin-code</b></i> directory.
</blockquote>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Did you test with a Sleep(5) call before the Wait() call in the
TermBin() code (so the child process can try to exit first and
get into the zombie state), and the runtime can still work?
<li>
How are background running processes handled, such as those with
symbol "&" appended to a shell command?
<li>
What're entailed to make our OS to cater the background-running
feature stated above? (The capacity to service signal IPC?)
</ol>
