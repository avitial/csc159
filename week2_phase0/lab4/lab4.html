<h3>Lab Tools Exercise 4 - Timer Event</h3>

<p>
<ol>
<!--
<li>
To reprogram timer interrupt interval, understand the original code:
#define CLK_TCK 100                    // set IRQ 0 100Hz
#define  TICKS  (1192180/CLK_TCK)
// tell 8253: counter #0, load lobyte then hibyte, mode 4, binary
    outportb(PIT0_TMRCTL,0x34);        // control word: 0011.0100b
    outportb(PIT0_TMR0, LOBYTE(TICKS));
    outportb(PIT0_TMR0, HIBYTE(TICKS));

<li>
This exercise presumes you have already completed the previous
exercises. The objective of this exercise is to practice how to
program to use the timer interrupt events.
<p>
<li>
In the real lab (RVR2001), copy the demo to run it. First enter shell command
to copy something in <a href=lab4stuff>Lab 4 Stuff</a>:<pre>
<b>cp ~changw/html/159/0/lab4stuff/Demo.dli  .</b></pre>
(note the dot symbol at the end) and issue the flash command to
load it and run it. (See from the class front page, in the project
phase table, about how to use flash.) If in the virtual machine
Ubuntu terminal shell, use "scp" command instead of course:<pre>
<b>scp (your ECS login name)@atoz.ecs.csus.edu:~changw/html/159/0/lab4stuff/Demo.dli  .</b></pre>
<p>
<li>
Write your own code following class lectures and this:
<a href=lab4stuff/big.png><b>pseudo code image</b></a>.
Compile into <i>MyOS.dli</i>, <i>flash</i> it in, and run it under GDB.
<ol type=a>
<li>The timer-driven routine should output your name, character by character.
<li>The output sequence is at every 3/4 seconds one character is shown.
<li>The output location is at the center of the screen on the target PC.
<li>After the full name is shown, it then erases it and restart.
</ol>
<p>
<li>
See "<a href=lab4stuff/example.c><b>example.c</b></a>" which shows
a few useful given SPEDE I/O functions you can use.
<p>
<li>
After getting it to work as described above, submit only the
source/text files you've typed in: <b>main.c, handlers.c, events.h,
events.S, and spede.h</b>. Locate the subdirectory named "phase0" in
the dropbox on SAMBA host Voyager, and look into it for be a designated
folder under your name. If you don't find it, create it with command
<i>mkdir</i> yourself.
