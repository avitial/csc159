<h2>Dev Tools and Timer Event</h2>

<p>
Apply an ECS computer account from http://www.ecs.csus.edu if you don't
have one.
<br>
The objective of these exercises is to make sure you are familiar with the
procedures for compiling, linking, downloading, executing and debugging
programs in the 159 OS development environment.
<br>
This tool-usage exercise must be done individually.
This is also the period to consider and get to form a team.

<p>

<b>Lab Development Tools and Timer Event</b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<a href=../../class_docs/UnixVi.html>Lab Exercise 1</a>
-- Refresh Your Unix and Vi Skills</a>
You are expected to be familiar with basic Linux commands including how
to login, create, and edit source code, and set executable search "path".
If not, you should practice Linux shell commands.

You should have readily obtained an ECS computer account (login name).
For submission of assignments.

use the SAMBA file-transfer client to connect to host Voyager where there's
a dropbox desination for you:<pre>
   While being <i>in the directory</i> where your have files ready to submit, issue shell command:
   <b>smbclient -U ECS\\<i>your ECS login name</i> //voyager.ecs.csus.edu/faculty</b>
   (<i>ECS\\ may not be needed from within the ECS subnet.</i>)
   smb: \> <b>help</b>
   smb: \> <b>help prompt</b>
   smb: \> <b>cd changw/dropbox/159/phase0</b>
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\> <b>dir</b>
   (<i>If not seeing your name, create one:</i> <b>mkdir</i> <i>your name</i></b>
   (<i>Name format: lastname,firstname, no space between.</i>)
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\> <b>cd <i>your name</i></b>
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\<i>your name</i>\> <b>put typescript</b>
   (<i>Typescript is the file you generated from lab 3.</i>)
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\<i>your name</i>\> <b>dir</b> <i>Check if it is in.</i>
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\<i>your name</i>\> <b>quit</b> <i>Back to shell.</i>
   <i>Issue the SAMBA client command again (smbclient...) and navigate into the same designated folder:</i>
   smb: \> <b>cd changw/dropbox/159/phase0/<i>your name</i></b>
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\<i>your name</i>\> <b>prompt</b> <i>Turn off prompting.</i>
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\<i>your name</i>\> <b>mput *.c *.h *.S</b>
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\<i>your name</i>\> <b>dir</b> <i>Check if they are in.</i>
   smb: changw\dropbox\159\phase0\<i>your name</i>\> <b>quit</b> <i>Back to shell.</i>
</pre>

You must work on these exercises and submit (individually). Get acquainted
with others to form a team. Once you have decided a team name (naming
convention is the same as that of naming a variable in a program, no spaces
or special symbols except underscores, and case sensitive), Email the TEAM
NAME as well as the members' names to the instructor. Each solo team must
also choose a team name.
<p>
Starting phase 1, Always put your team and member names at the beginning
of your "main.c" code, and specify the project-phase number.
<p>
The 'dropbox' only allows a file to be created/written once.
It cannot be renamed/removed once dropped (even for empty files or folders
accidentally created).
To resubmit, issue shell commands to make a new folder using a name
like "V2,", "V3," etc. (still under your team folder originally designated
to submit code of that phase), and then "cd" into it to try again.
Grading will only be done on the folder of the latest version. Any
submission after the due date will incur late penalty and void all previous
versions of submission for that phase.
