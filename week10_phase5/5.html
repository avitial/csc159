Device Driver:"Interrupt Driven"</b></big><br>
</center>
<p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The goal of this phase is to learn how a device driver that handles
two-way communication works and to be incorporated into an OS to serve
processes to interact with users at peripherals such as <tt>terminal</tt>
devices (TTY, teletype)</tt>.
<p>
<li>
The test will be done by a terminal process that is to send and receive
text data via a serial data port. This is usually called the <i>upper-half</i>
in driver software. The <i>lower half</i> of the software is the handler code
triggered by the electronics of the port. The PC <i>IRQ</i> numbers 3 and 4
are the designated interrupt wires that eventually evoke the OS event handler
<i>PortHandler()</i>.
<p>
<li>
Besies a hardware port there is a software <i>port_t</i> data structure
that interfaces both halves of the device driver. It buffers input and
output with the use of semaphores to <i>flow control</i> the buffers.
It also contains other information about the port.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>The Upper and Lower Halves</h3>
<ol>
<li>
A device-driver upper-half is a process that requests a read or
write via I/O data buffers. The lower-half is a handler which
also read/write the I/O buffers but only does this asynchronously
from the upper-half (whence IRQ events occur).
<p>
<li>
The serial ports in a PC used to connect to terminals are <tt>COM2</tt>
and <tt>COM3</tt> ports. As a port event occurs, either IRQ 3 or 4 is
sent to the PIC. The event numbers are 35 and 36. The PIC mask must be
set to open up for them  (added to the original timer IRQ 0). The handler
code must in the end dismiss the events (with PIC).
<p>
<li>
The handler <i><b>PortHandler</i></b> reads an <i>Interrupt Indicator
Register</i> (IIR) from the port circuit. On event <tt>TXRDY</tt>
(Transmit Ready), a character from the port write data buffer is sent
to the port data register. On event <tt>RXRDY</tt> (Receive Ready), the
handler to read from the port data register and enqueue it to the read
data buffer. There are semaphores to flow-control the use of the buffers 
between a process (upper half) and the handler code (lower half).
<p>
<li>
A special condition must be understood and treated. As a port is reset,
it is ready to accept transmission (a TXRDY event is assumed). Also,
after sending the last character to the port, the subsequent TXRDY will
have no more character to send. So the handler code must save the information
of this port condition in a flag in order to start sending as new transmission
is requested by a process.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>The Port Data Structure</h3>
<ol>
<li>
What is to be prompted to the terminal is first queued to the write
buffer, <tt>write_q</tt>, as it is called in the port data structure.
The lower half, working in the background to handler IRQ events, dequeues
this buffer and send it to the port data register (so it can be taken
by the remote terminal to display).
<p>
<li>
Semaphore <tt>write_sid</tt> is needed to flow-control between the two
halves. The <i>passes</i> of the semaphore should start at the number
of character spaces the buffer can handle. The upper half first calls
the semaphore to wait before enqueuing a character into the write_q.
The lower-half, conversely, will does semaphore-posting as a character
is dequeued from it (to send out via the port).
<p>
<li>
Corollarily, the two halves work jointly using semaphore <tt>read_sid</tt>
flow-control the <tt>read_q</tt>. The <i>passes</i> of this semaphore
should start at zero. As a character is typed at a terminal, arriving
at the port, it triggers an IRQ event, and the handler will be called
upon to read from the port and enqueue it to the read_q, and the code
also does a semaphore-posting which can release the upper half.
<p>
<li>
A third buffer <tt>loopback_q</tt> is to loop back the typing from the
terminal. As each character is queued into the read_q, it is also queued
to loopback_q.
<p>
<li>
Hence, the lower-half must also check if there are characters in the
loopback_q, besides the write_q. The handler code can be coded to favor
the loopback_q over the write_q (or not, or evenly).
Looping data back is the <i>full-duplex</i> communication mode to facilitate
data verification to the originator. The loopback_q is not <i>flow-controlled</i>
in our usage.
<p>
<li>
A port and its associated data structrue is allocated via service all
<tt>int PortAlloc(void)</tt>. Most information about the port will be set
by <tt>void PortAllocHandler(void)</tt>, but the two semaphores are being
allocated in the service call PortAlloc(), after the port number is returned.
<p>
<li>
The PortAllocHandler() sets the serial-port communication parametrics:
transmission speed 9600 bauds (bits per second), with a format: 7 data bits,
even-parity check, and 1 stop bit. The handler also enables the two types
of events TXRDY or RXRDY for IRQ.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

As before, submit only source-code files (*.c *.h entry.S) to your team
dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated phase folder.

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
How did you expand the use of multiple terminals?
Hint: an array of port data, argument passing for common functions to know which
port to use, and multiple sets of upper-half processes during the bootstrap.<pre>
   IRQ 4 line: COM 1, 3, 5, and 7
   IRQ 3: line COM 2, 4, 6, and 8
   COM 1~8 I/O bases: 0x3f8 0x2f8 0x3e8 0x2e8 0x2f0 0x3e0 0x2e0 0x260</pre>
<p>
<li>
How can we alter the code to favor process prompting over looping back typed
characters from the terminal?
<p>
<li>
Not showing what is typed when typing passwords is a loopback-disabling measures,
how can we achieve this?
<p>
<li>
How can a device driver be dynamically added/removed (hot-pluggable)?
That is, can an OS starts without having a device driver, and later have
it added/enrolled? Do we need a special kernel service?
<p>
<li>
How would you expand the knowledge of handling multiple devices on a single
IRQ line to understand how a <tt>bus controller</tt> works?
(E.g., one IRQ line catering servicing devices on multiple COM ports.)
