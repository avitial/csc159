<h3>Device Driver Construction</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The goals of this phase is to learn some basics of a device
driver, and how to extend our OS for device services.
<p>
<li>
A peripheral device is often coupled with driver software
which can be in the form of a handler. This method is oftern
coined "busy poll." The advantages are to enable the kernel
to have total control in event handling. The kernel can thus
check for time-out, force a task abort, etc., during the usage
or request for a device. The disadvantages is the lengthy time
to run which may bog down the OS performance.
<p>
<li>
To handle an I/O device which is usually much slower than a
CPU, the driver repeatedly polls the status of an I/O port
for its readiness (or be deeemed a time-out). We will first
build a device driver (a handler) to communicate with a conventional
dot-matrix printer.
<p>
<li>
The directory <b><i>"busy-poll"</b></i> contains the demonstration
code on how the so-named method is carried out. Use a separate
directory to copy the source file and compile it to run. Study how
<i>busy-poll.c</i> is constructed.
<p>
<li>
Move the keyboard input handling from Kernel() into process
<tt>Init</tt> which will upon the <i><b>p</b></i> key, prints out
a message string to the printer. We only need two key events:
the 'b' (for GDB breakpoint) and 'p' (to test printing).
<p>
<li>
The new service call to print is <i><b>void SysPrint(char *str_to_print)</b></i>
which process Init will use (when 'p' key is pressed). Via this call
the address of the string-to-print will be passed to the kernel.
The kernel then calls the handler <i><b>SysPrintHandler(char *)</b></i>
to print. Assocaited with this new service there are, similar to before,
a new constant <i><b>SYSPRINT_EVENT</i></b> and an assembler interface
<i><b>SysPrintEvent</i></b> of which its address is set into the IDT.
<p>
<li>
By now, you should be very familiar with adding a new OS service:
add new code to files <i>events.S/.h, services.c/.h, handlers.c/.h</i>;
add main.c will have a new IDT registration and switch case.
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<blockquote>
The source code submitted to your designated Voyager dropbox as before.
Besides the source code, a <i><b>HARDCOPY</b></i> of the printout from lab
RVR2001 using one of the dot-matrix printers in there. The hardcopy must
contains 10 lines of consecutive printing out the string of your team name
and team member names. Run demo.dli to see what the format is. The hardcopy
is to be collected in the first class session following the due date.
</blockquote>

<h3>Question</h3>
<blockquote>
<li>
The needed time delay after resetting the printer port, where and how
to get it? Sleep(1) in the handler?
<li>
Can the inefficient and lengthy handler SysPrintHandler() be elated off
its heavy duty? (Let the service call takes does the looping of the string
to print and sends each character to at the time. But, in in this case
the resetting of the printer will have be done beforehand (before the loop)
hard-coded or via another "int" call?)
<li>
Expand from the above, the concept of a "cooperative" OS (CF "preemptive"):
voluntary sleep/delay calls, requesting to lower own scheduling priority
(the "nice" unix command).
<li>
How can our OS avoid mixing up print jobs if multiple processes send
print requests, e.g., calling SysPrint(), at the same time?
