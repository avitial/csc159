<h3>Goals</h3>

<ol>
<li>
In the previous OS phase a new processes was created in a given
DRAM memory segment. In this phase a virtual memory space will be
given to expand runtime space virtually from 1G ~ 2G-1 (0x40000000
~ 0x7fffffff) bytes.
<p>
<li>
Virtual address space is supported by real DRAM pages during the
process runtime, although partially (a few pages at a time). The
CPU component that translates a virtual address is the <i>Memory
Management Unit (MMU)</i>. It translates all addresses the CPU asks
for either instruction or data, on the fly, during each cycle of
instruction fetch and execution.
<p>
<li>
The compiled and linked executable files will carry virtual addresses
by default. The virtual address of the trapframe will be set toward the
end of the process' virtual space, <i>2G - size of the trapframe</i>,
and the code will start at virtual <i>1G</i> bytes. These numbers will be
the same for all new processes created via "fork" service calls.
<p>
<li>
The "fork" service will also create address-translation tables so the
MMU can use them. Before a process is loaded to run by <i>Loader()</i>,
our kernel code must first set the MMU to the address of the right
translation table.
<p>
<li>
The MMU actually uses translation tables all the time. There is a
set of translation tables the kernel has been using since its bootstrap.
They are made by the initial SPEDE setup code ("boot-loader"). Some of
these tables must be included as part of the translation tables for a
newly process in order for it to make kernel service calls.
</ol>

<h3>Address Translation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The Intel MMU has a <i>two-tier</i> memory paging system: the leftmost
10 bits in a 32-bit virtual address will be used as the entry index
into the main translation table to find a real address that points to a
translation subtable. And, the next 10 bits in the virtual address will
be used as the entry index into the subtable to find a real address that
points to a code/stack page. The rest 12 bits in the virtual address
will be the byte index in the code/stack page found.
<p>
<li>
What will be added to the PCB: <tt>int MMU</tt>, which is the address
of the main address-translation table to set the CPU MMU (before the
Loader() call) for running the process in virtual space. This number
is initialized zero during bootstrap stage of our OS, and is later set
by ForkHandler() when creating a process to run in a virtual space.
<p>
<li>
An entry in the main table is set with a real address leading to a
subtable. In terms, an entry in a subtable can be set with a real
address of a memory page (containing code/stack). Entries in tables
are usually sparsely used. During runtime, new pages may be needed
(page faults) as instructions may read/write at virtual addresses
outside of the initial virtual space.
<p>
<li>
The ForkHandler() will start by allocating five (not just one) memory
pages in order to create: one main address-translation table and tw.
subtables (one to point to code pages, one to point to stack pages),
plus the actual inital code and stack pages. A main/subtable has 1024
entries, each entry is 4 bytes in size; a total of 4KB (a memory page).
<p>
<li>
There are two entries in the main address-translation table that point
to two (code and stack) subtables, they are given the real addresses
of two memory pages allocated. Since the virtual process space starts
at 1G (0x40000000), the first 10 bits is 256<sub>10</sub>; and this is
also the index of the entry in the main table that holds the real address
(of one subtable). And since the stack ends virtually 2G-1B and the first
10 bits of this number is 511<sub>10</sub> which will be the index of the
entry in the main table having the other real address (of the other subtable).
<p>
<li>
In the main address-translation table will also need to have its first
four entries copy from what the kernel is currently using. The SPEDE
function <i>int get_cr3()</i> can be used to obtain this (<i>int kernel_MMU</i>).
This is to be done during the bootstrap stage of our OS. The ForkHandler()
can then uses it to do the copying. These four entries enables a process
to call for kernel services.
<p>
<li>
In the code subtable, the 1st entry is to be set with the real address
of a memory page which will have a copy of the executable from the file
service. In the stack subtable the last entry is to be set to the real
address of another memory page to house the initial trapframe of the a
new process. The EIP in the trapframe will be set with the virtual address
1G (0x40000000). The trapframe address of the PCB for this new process
will be 2G - size of trapframe type.
<p>
<li>
To set the MMU the SPEDE function <tt>void set_cr3(int)</tt> is used.
This is done before loading a new process to run, and upon the exiting
of a process (to switch back to the kernel translation table).
</ol>

<h3>Details of Address Translation</h3>

<ol>
<li>
The MMU has a 2-tier translation scheme (a main table paired with several
subtables): given a 32-bit virtual address, it is divided into three parts:
the first and second 10 bits, and the rest 12 bits. The first 10 bits forms
the entry number (index) in the main table where a real address of a subtable
should have been stored (otherwise, a "Page Fault"). The second 10 bits is
the entry number (index) in the subtable (found by the first 10 bits) where
a real address of a memory page should have been given (otherwise, "Page Fault").
The last 12 bits forms the byte offset in the final memory page found.
<p>
<li>
In short, ForkHandler allocates five memory pages and a new PID, and it creates:
   <ol type=i>
   <li>a main table, which has 6 valid entries to set (in order to point to 6
       subtables). The first 4 entries are copied from the kernel main table.
       The entries 256 and 511 have real addresses to two subtables (bleow).
   <li>One code subtable, in which entry 0 has a real address to a code page.
   <li>One stack subtable, in which entry 1023 has a real address to stack page.
   <li>The code page has the executable copied from the file service.
   <li>The stack page has an initial process trapframe with its EIP set 1G.
   <li>The new PCB has the trapfrme address set 2G-size of trapframe type.
   </ol>
<p>
<li>
Right before loading a process, if this address indicated in the PCB has been
set (not zero), the MMU must be set with this address by <tt>void set_cr3(int)</tt>.
<p>
<li>
In <i>main()</i> use <i>get_cr3</i> to set <i>kernel_MMU</i>. This address
is later used by to create a main table in ForkHandler(), and to return from
a virtual-space table in ExitHandler().
<p>
<li>
Since memory pages are intervals of 4K bytes, only the first 20 bits in
the addresses actually change. The last 12 bits are always zeros. So these
bits are used as flags to notify the MMU the attributes of the memory page,
during the hardware address translation. The right most seven flags (bits)
are important to a OS:
<ol type=a>
<li><tt>PRESENT</tt>, 0: page not present, 1: page present.
<li><tt>RO / RW</tt> , 0: page is read-only, 1: read-writable
<li><tt>USER MODE</tt>, 0: superuser to access, 1: user can access
<li><tt>CACHE POLICY</tt>, 0: write back; 1: write-through (if cache-use set)
<li><tt>CACHE USE</tt>, 0: page content not to be cached, 1: to be cached
<li><tt>ACCESSED</tt>, 0: entry never looked up by MMU, 1: accessed
<li><tt>DIRTY</tt>, 0: page content not changed/written, 1: changed/written
</ol>
<p>
<li>
In each valid entry, we will set both flags RW and Present to 1 (others 0).
This must be done correctly while setting new table entries.
<p>
<li>
The target PC would reboot whenever an address translation cannot be 
arried out (due to any conflicts from these flags). The page being
"not present," RW on RO pages, user/super mode, etc., are all possible
causes. Use GDB to verify both the PCB and tables are correctly done
at the end of the ForkHandler().

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
Source files, including the directory <i><b>bin-code</b></i> that has
your assembly code to be verified.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Where in your kernel code set_cr3() calls must be given?
<p>
<li>
What are the type of CPU exceptions that may occur as the MMU looks
into a table entry during its effort of address translation?
<p>
<li>
How can we code a process so it will need new pages during runtime?
How can your OS handle this? Wouldn't the handling/recovering of a
page fault requires rolling back the program counter of the CPU to
retry the same intruction (that caused the error)?
<p>
<li>
What is the pragmatic reason of using the 2-tier translation scheme?
<p>
<li>
How can our OS maintain a healthy proportion of DRAM space not used?
Should there be a "swapper" daemon process? How can LRU counts be
implemented? How to indicate a page was swapped out in the swap space
(not brand new)?
<p>
<li>
Can translation tables also be swapped in and out with the support of
a "swap space" like the code and stack pages themselves?
<p>
<li>
The MMU has TLB to cache table entries. The instruction and data are
cached separately. Should the search for a cache hit be based on a
virtual or real address?
