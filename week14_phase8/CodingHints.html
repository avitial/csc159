<center><h2>Phase 8 Virtual Memory</h2></center>

Must work on two terminals. Program and build a new "printer_msg.s"
into "bin_code/." It prints to the printer a greeing message (run demo)
and returns the virtual address of its local message to TermProc.
Add "Sleep(4);" before Wait() call, in TermBin(), in order to test
if the wait call is after the exit call of the child process.

<h3>Address Translation Tables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Your OS will need a new global data: <tt>int kernel_MMU</tt> which
is initialized during main() by calling <tt>int get_cr3(void)</tt>.
This is the address of the main kernel address-translation table
the MMU has been using for our kernel (the real-address mode).
<li>
In the PCB type a new info is to be needed: <tt>int MMU</tt> which
will hold the address to the main address-translation table of the
process. This is used as the argument to call <tt>set_cr3(int)</tt>
to set the MMU before calling Loader().
In main(), the MMU in all the PCB are to be set to zero initially.
In ForkHandler(), the MMU of the PCB of the new process is set to
the address of the main table built in a memory page.
<li>
How the MMU translates a virtual address:
as a process EIP is set virtually 1G (0x40000000), the first 10 bits
is 256 so that entry in the main table will be read as the address
of a code subtable. The next 10 bits of the virtual address is 0 so
entry 0 of the subtable is read as the memory address of a code page.
The last 12 bits of the virtual address is 0 so the instruction is
fetched at byte 0 (in the code page).
<li>
To load the trapframe set virtually at 2G-64 (0xffffffc0): again,
the first 10 bits of that address is 511 so that entry in the main
table is read to locate a stack subtable. The second 10 bits is
1023 so that entry in the subtable is read to find the memory page
for the runtime stack. The last 12 bits is 4032 so that is where
in the stack page to fetch the trapframe (the data structure).
<li>
When setting an entry, set two flags <tt>RW</tt> and <tt>Present</tt>
to 1. Others left 0. A bitwise "OR" operation with 0x3 adds them to
a real address, e.g., address X | 0x3 yields a combined binary ...11.
</ol>

<h3>Reclaiming Virtual Memory</h3>
<blockquote>
When memory pages are reclaimed by ExitHandler, the target PC may
reboot if the MMU is not returned the original kernel translation
tables.

<h3>ForkHandler Revisited</h3>
<blockquote>
<pre>void ForkHandler(char *bin_code, int *child_pid) {
   int i, got, page_got[5];
   TF_t *TF_p;                                                 // local ptr, use below
   char *main_table, *code_table, *stack_table, *code_page, *stack_page; // easy naming

A. try to locate 5 free memory pages:
   set 'got' to 0

   loop i thru mem_page[i]
      if owner is 0
         page_got[got++] = i  // got 1 page index
         if 'got' enough (becomes 5), break loop

   if didn't get 5
      cons_printf("Kernel Panic: not enough memory pages available!\n");
      set 0 as what child_pid points
      return (end this handler)

B. if free_q.size is 0
      cons_printf("Kernel Panic: no PID available!\n");
      set 0 as what child_pid points
      return (end this handler)

C. set the better-named addresses (char *) from the 5 allocated memory pages:
      main_table = address of the 1st DRAM page allocated
      code_table = ... 2nd ...
      stack_table = ... 3rd ...
      code_page = ... 4th ...
      stack_page = ... 5th ...

D. get a new PID (set it as what child_pid now points) from free_q

   loop 'got' from 0 to 4:
      set the owner of memory pages (indexed by page_got[got]) to the new pid
      clear the same memory page

   clear its PCB
   enqueue its PID to ready_q
   update its state
   update its ppid, too
   set its TF_p to 2G (0x80000000) - size of trapframe type  <------- ***
   set the MMU in the PCB of the new process to main_table <------- ***

E. copy the code into code_page (from the given argument)

F. set local variable TF_p to stack_page + MEM_PAGE_SIZE - sizeof(TF_t) <------- ***
   set TF_p->EIP of TF to 1G (0x40000000)                          <------- ***
   set rest of TF_p->xxx the same way as before

G. MyMemcpy 1st 4 entries from kernel_MMU into main_table
   Set entries 256 of main_table to code_table (bitwise-OR the two flags)
   Set entries 511 of main_table to stack_table (bitwise-OR the two flags)
   set entry 0 in code_table to code_page (bitwise-OR the two flags)
   set entry 1023 in stack_table to stack_page (bitwise-OR the two flags)
</blockquote>

<h3>WaitHandler() Revisited</h3>
<blockquote>
As a zombie child is found to return the exit number to the parent, the MMU may
need to temporarily set to the child's translation table in order to access its
EAX in the trapframe which is a virtual address. After that change the MMU back.
</blockquote>

<h3>Helpful GDB Commands</h3>
<blockquote><pre>
To check the trapframe address of process 4:
   gdb> p pcb[4].TF_p
To see the content of the TF itself (in decimal values):
   gdb> p/d *pcb[4].TF_p
To see what's in entry 256 of main_table (by array notation):
   gdb> p main_table[256]
To see what's in entry 511 of some table at 0xe00000 (by pointer notation):
   gdb> p *(0xe00000 + 511 * 4)
To see what's in entry 1023 of some table at 0xe02000 (by pointer notation, in decimal):
   gdb> p/d *(0xe02000 + 1023 * 4)
Other useful GDB commands:
   gdb> p current_pid
   gdb> p code_table
   gdb> p port[1]
   gdb> p port[1].write_q
   gdb> p sem[1]
   gdb> p mem_page[0]
   gdb> where
   gdb> info b
   gdb> info reg
   gdb> del 2
